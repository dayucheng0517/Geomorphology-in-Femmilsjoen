# Geomorphology-in-Femmilsjoen
paper from Jack

## Abstract

### 1. Study Area
North Svalbard >> Spitsbergen >> Femmilsjoen Area

### 2. Regional Physiography
#### A low-relief, high elevation mountain plateau 
+ High-relief steep slopes
+ Low-relief coastal lowlands

### 3. Glaciers 
+ Warm-based
+ Erosive
+ Low terrain

### 4. Glaciers on Plateau
+ Colder
+ Less erosive
+ During the Late Weichselian

## Intro

### - Present
1. Glacial retreat
2. More frequent wave
3. Thawing of permafrost
4. Results in enhanced solifluction
5. Erosional and depositional processes

### - Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)
1.  the Svalbard Barents-Sea Ice Sheet covered the archipelago

### - Geomorphological maps
1. Reconstruct the spatiotemporal pattern of glacial retreat
2. Monitoring and comparison of future landscape change
3. Understanding of individual landforms and the links between them, as well as the process

### - Glaciers and Periglacial environments
1. Glaciers and ice caps cover 57% of the Svalbard archipelago
2. Large ice-cored moraines and exposed glacial bedforms are prominent formed by Late Holocene glacier advances
3. Several of these moraines originate from quasi-periodic dynamic surge advances, not directly related to mass balance

### - Nonglacial landforms
1. Blockfields
2. Alluvial fans
4. Areas with extensive raised marine sediments
5. Sets of beach ridges
6. Colluvial fans covering the steeper slopes

### - This Study
1. Geomorphological and surficial geologic mapping based on aerial image interpretation 
2. Field mapping of the terrestrial area surrounding Lake Femmilsjøen and the foreland of Midtsundstadbreen

## Setting

### 2.1 Study area

#### - Mapped area
1. West : Wijdefjorden
2. East : Longstaffbreen and Midtsundstadbreen
 + Longstaffbreen : a surge-type glacier (1960s)
 + Midtsundstadbreen :  a lobate shape with a relatively steep front
3. Bedrock : **the Atomfjella Antiform** (metasediments and granitic gneisses)

#### - Around Femmilsjoen
> The Vassfaret Formation : 
> + a steeply, westward dipping succession of semipelites (泥質序列)
> + feldspar-rich gneisses
> + psammites (砂岩)
> + foliated amphibolites (角閃岩)
+ The Vassfaret Formation overlies the Bangenhuken Complex
> The Bangenhuken Complex : 
> + well-lineated (線理) , medium- to coarse-grained granitic gneisses with subordinate intercalations (次要的夾層) of metasediments

#### - North Ny-Friesland
1. E-W striking faults with joint sets of similar orientation
2. The strike  correlated with the orientation of the axis of the tributary (支流) fjords and outlet glaciers
3. Understanding of individual landforms and the links between them, as well as the process

### - Topography
1. Undulating (起伏的)
2. Numerous lakes
3. *Marine limit (冰磧稜線)*
4. *The marine isolation threshold (冰磧分隔臨界點=冰斗湖前丘)*
> cal. ka BP = calibrated kiloannus (1000yr) before present (1950)
> *What is the c.in c. 11.7 ± 0.3 and c. 11.3 ± 0.2 cal. ka BP?*
5. Coastal lowland
6. Open hilly landscape

### 2.2  Climate and glaciers

#### - Continuous Permafrost
1. 90% of the land surface
2. A modelled thickness ranging from 100 to 500 m
3. The active layer thickness is 1–2m
4. Mean monthly air temp. above zero occur from June through September

#### - Climate
1. Interaction of the West Spitsbergen Current (WSC) and the sea-ice covered Arctic Ocean
> 
#### - North Ny-Friesland
