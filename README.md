paper from Jack

## Abstract

### 1. Study Area
North Svalbard >> Spitsbergen >> Femmilsjoen Area

### 2. Regional Physiography
#### A low-relief, high elevation mountain plateau 
+ High-relief steep slopes
+ Low-relief coastal lowlands

### 3. Glaciers 
+ Warm-based
+ Erosive
+ Low terrain

### 4. Glaciers on Plateau
+ Colder
+ Less erosive
+ During the Late Weichselian

## Intro

### - Present
1. Glacial retreat
2. More frequent wave
3. Thawing of permafrost
4. Results in enhanced solifluction
5. Erosional and depositional processes

### - Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)
1.  the Svalbard Barents-Sea Ice Sheet covered the archipelago

### - Geomorphological maps
1. Reconstruct the spatiotemporal pattern of glacial retreat
2. Monitoring and comparison of future landscape change
3. Understanding of individual landforms and the links between them, as well as the process

### - Glaciers and Periglacial environments
1. Glaciers and ice caps cover 57% of the Svalbard archipelago
2. Large ice-cored moraines and exposed glacial bedforms are prominent formed by Late Holocene glacier advances
3. Several of these moraines originate from quasi-periodic dynamic surge advances, not directly related to mass balance

### - Nonglacial landforms
1. Blockfields
2. Alluvial fans
4. Areas with extensive raised marine sediments
5. Sets of beach ridges
6. Colluvial fans covering the steeper slopes

### - This Study
1. Geomorphological and surficial geologic mapping based on aerial image interpretation 
2. Field mapping of the terrestrial area surrounding Lake Femmilsjøen and the foreland of Midtsundstadbreen

## Setting

### 2.1 Study area

#### - Mapped area
1. West : Wijdefjorden
2. East : Longstaffbreen and Midtsundstadbreen
 + Longstaffbreen : a surge-type glacier (1960s)
 + Midtsundstadbreen :  a lobate shape with a relatively steep front
3. Bedrock : **the Atomfjella Antiform** (metasediments and granitic gneisses)

#### - Around Femmilsjoen
> The Vassfaret Formation : 
> + a steeply, westward dipping succession of semipelites (泥質序列)
> + feldspar-rich gneisses
> + psammites (砂岩)
> + foliated amphibolites (角閃岩)
+ The Vassfaret Formation overlies the Bangenhuken Complex
> The Bangenhuken Complex : 
> + well-lineated (線理) , medium- to coarse-grained granitic gneisses with subordinate intercalations (次要的夾層) of metasediments

#### - North Ny-Friesland
1. E-W striking faults with joint sets of similar orientation
2. The strike  correlated with the orientation of the axis of the tributary (支流) fjords and outlet glaciers
3. Understanding of individual landforms and the links between them, as well as the process

### - Topography
1. Undulating (起伏的)
2. Numerous lakes
3. *Marine limit (冰磧稜線)*
4. *The marine isolation threshold (冰磧分隔臨界點=冰斗湖前丘)*
> cal. ka BP = calibrated kiloannus (1000yr) before present (1950)
> *What is the c.in c. 11.7 ± 0.3 and c. 11.3 ± 0.2 cal. ka BP?*
5. Coastal lowland
6. Open hilly landscape

### 2.2  Climate and glaciers

#### - Continuous Permafrost
1. 90% of the land surface
2. A modelled thickness ranging from 100 to 500 m
3. The active layer thickness is 1–2m
4. Mean monthly air temp. above zero occur from June through September

#### - Climate
1. Interaction of the West Spitsbergen Current (WSC) and the sea-ice covered Arctic Ocean
> Advection : the transport of a substance or quantity by bulk motion of a fluid
2. Arctic amplification (AA) :　the warming in the Arctic has been much faster than in the rest of the world
> Configuration : an arrangement of elements in a particular form or combination
+ Climate change > A thickening of the active layer > Slope instability and coastal erosion
3. The northern Arctic Tundra (凍原) zone
4. the sea-ice minimum occurs during July through November, when the sea-ice extent (面積) is below 20%

## Methods

### - The geomorphological mapping
1. Based on aerial images
2. Digital elevation modal (DEM)
3. Field mapping
4. Oblique (傾斜的) aerial images
5. Erosional and depositional processes

### - Fieldwork
1. A handheld GPS
2. Landforms were described and photographed
3. Follows the standard for Quaternary geological maps
4. Bathymetric (測深) data

## Geomorphology and surficial geology map units

### - The low-relief coastal lowlands
1. Sets of terraces (階地) with coastal landforms and marine sediments
2. The marine sediments occur up to ~8km inland
3. The uppermost marine deposits occur at ~72 m a.s.l.
4. Oblique (傾斜的) aerial images
5. Erosional and depositional processes

### - The transition from coastal lowland to the mountain plateau
1. Steep terrain with small lakes in depressions (低窪地)
2. Slope deposits dominate

### - The mountain plateau
1. Low-relief terrain extending from about 5km inland
2. The elevation ranges from ~220 m a.s.l. to ~287 m a.s.l
3. *Rolling, in situ (原位) weathered bedrock hills and periglacially (冰緣環境=歷經凍融循環的地區) altered surfaces in between*
4. Perennial snow patches (多年生的雪塊) are abundant
5. The glacier front is steep
6. A supraglacial ridge with diamictic (混雜沉積岩) composition running parallel to the ice margin

### 4.1  Landforms from the last glaciation

#### 4.1.1. Exposed bedrock

##### - Fractures
1. In the bedrock surface
2. In front of the ice margin
3. Small-scale indicators of subglacial erosion

##### -  Striated bedrock

3. Diameter up to 4 m
4. Stripes
5. On the bedrock plateau
6. In the eastern part of the study area
7. The presence of silt-rich, fine-grained material is a precondition for sorted circles to form
8. A thin till cover deposited during full glacial conditions and has provided the fine sediments to allow the sorted circles to form

2. An interior of diamict with sub-rounded clasts (=detritus=岩屑) and shell fragments
3. In the NW part of the study area south of Gunvorvatnet
4. The orientation of the ridge is parallel to the coast, so it's a marginal moraine
