## Intro

### - Present
1. Glacial retreat
2. More frequent wave
3. Thawing of permafrost
4. Results in enhanced solifluction
5. Erosional and depositional processes

### 4.2 Landforms from the last deglaciation

#### 4.2.1. Boulders

##### - Of local lithology
1. Rock-fall deposits

##### - Of exotic lithologies
1. Erratics (a rock or boulder that differs from the surrounding rock and is believed to have been brought from a distance by glacial action) deposited during glacial retreat

#### 4.2.2. Marginal moraines 

##### - One clearly defined ridge
1. Angular to sub-rounded boulders on the surface
2. An interior of diamict with sub-rounded clasts (=detritus=岩屑) and shell fragments
3. In the NW part of the study area south of Gunvorvatnet
4. The orientation of the ridge is parallel to the coast, so it's a marginal moraine

##### - Another distinct ridge
1. A marginal moraine
2. In the SE part of the study area immediately in front of the glacier margin of Midtsundstadbreen

##### - Three less distinct ridges
1. Remnants (剩餘) of lateral moraines
2. On a slope SE of Brennkollen
3. On the northern slope in the western end of Femmilsjøen

#### 4.2.3. Features marking former ice-margin positions

##### - A distinct border
1. Separates raised beach deposits to the east and bedrock to the west
2. The abundance of large erratics (>1 m) is high
3. A former ice-margin position
4. The beach deposits on the eastern part of the ridge have formed subsequent to (接下來) ice retreat.

##### - Four additional ice-marginal positions
1. Suble (不明顯的)
2. Have Higher concentrations of erratics

##### - One ice-marginal position
1. In the western end of Helgevatnet
2. A terrace-shaped deposit
3. Consisting of sand and gravel
4. A kame (=knob) terrace deposited in an ice-dammed
lake (In small areas, kames may form the terminal moraine.)

### 4.3 Raised marine deposits

#### 4.3.1.  Raised fine-grained glaciomarine deposits

##### - Diamict sediments with sporadic (零星的) clasts
1. Fine-grained, compact
2. Generally below 72 m a.s.l.
3. In the coastal area and the lower shores (between average low water neap tide 小潮 (MLWN) to the lowest the tide ever gets i.e. extreme low water spring tides 大潮 (ELWS).) of Femmilsjøen
4.Raised marine sediments

##### - Bivalve mollusc (斧足綱) shell fragments
1. Mya truncata
2. Hiatella arctica 

##### - Raised marine sediments 
1. Deposited in a glaciomarine environment, prior to postglacial glacioisostatic rebound
2. The composition is similar to observations of glaciomarine sediments in lake and marine sediment cores from the Femmilsjøen area (These landscape were form after Glacial retreat. So the original bedding may be raised marine sediments)

#### 4.3.2. Raised beach deposits

##### - Deposits of sand and gravel
1. 500m wide
2. Elevations from ~3 to ~72 m a.s.l.
3. Predominantly along the modern coastline of Wijdefjorden and up to 3.3 km inland
4. From coarse sand up to small boulders
5. Distinct ridges (~0.2 m high) occur
6. Raised beach deposits

##### - Raised beach deposits compared to modern
1. Coarser material
2. Shell fragments are rare
> The uppermost occurrence of raised beach deposits = The postglacial marine limit

### 4.4 Landforms of fluvial origin

#### 4.4.1. Fluvial and glaciofluvial deposits

##### - The channels
1. In the low-relief terrain parallel to the coast
2. With longitudinal bars of sorted sand and gravel as well as boulders
3. Oriented primarily perpendicular to and gently sloping towards the coast
4.Raised marine sediments

##### - A few of the channels active
1. Streams of running water occur
2. Fluvial channel

##### -  Similar channels occur on the plateau in front of
Midtsundstadbreen
1. The orientation and gradient are predominantly towards north, parallel to the ice-margin
2. Drain into Femmilsjøen, where small deltas form
3. On the surface of the glaciofluvial deposits, periglacial landforms such as sorted circles and stripes occur

> Most of the active streams occur in the channels close to the glacier front

#### 4.4.2. Incised channels

##### - Channels incised in bedrock
1. Up to 12 m deep and 50 m wide
2. The incisions are old and progressive with phases of erosion during deglaciations
3. Maybe subglacial gorges or short-lived fluvial erosion during ice retreat

> Where channels are incised into sediments, they are more likely to be of Holocene age

### 4.5 Landforms of Holocene origin

#### 4.5.1. Blockfields

##### - Fields of large angular boulders
1. Local lithologies
2. Mostly or completely covering the surface constitute
3. Dominate the plateaus
4. Likely be active through the Holocene
5. May have been revitalised (恢復生機) or relict (遺留) from previous ice-free periods

#### 4.5.2. Talus (崖錐) covered slopes, colluvial fans and rock glaciers

##### - The steep slopes
1. Covered by angular, scattered talus
2. Originate from weathering processes and rock falls.
3. Dominated by fans of angular debris, interpreted as colluvial fans composed of avalanche (雪崩) and debris-flow deposits

##### - The undulating ridges
1. Coarse debris on the surface occur at the
foot of a few NW facing slopes, south of Femmilsjøen
> Pressure ridges : caused by the flow of ice-cemented
talus at the toe of the colluvial fans.
> Rock glaciers : consisting either of angular rock debris frozen in interstitial (間隙的) ice, former "true" glaciers overlain by a layer of talus, or something in-between

#### 4.5.3. Solifluction (土石緩滑) material

##### - The gentler slopes
1. Covered by a thin soil
2. Creep occurs in the active layer
3. Solifluction material

#### 4.5.4. Lacustrine (湖泊的) deposits

##### - The deposits
1. Fine-grained (primarily silt)
2. Along the lake shores and in depressions across the entire area
3. Some of them are coarser gravel
4. The deposits occur up to ~1 m above the current lake surfaces
5. Remnants after higher lake levels

##### - The lakes level
1. More glacier proximal conditions > Higher meltwater supply > Higher lake levels = Higher base level 
2. Increased precipitation during the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) > Higher lake levels
> Expansion of taliks below shallow lakes without distinct outflows could also lower the lake levels

#### 4.5.5. Modern beach deposits

##### - The deposits
1. Sand and gravel
2. with actively forming ridges (~0.3 m high)
3. Up to 70 m wide
4. Up to 3 m a.s.l.
5. Separated by outcropping bedrock of positive relief
6. Occur in the bays along the coast of Wijdefjorden
7. Modern fair-weather beach ridges

##### - On the modern beaches
1. Driftwood is abundant
2. Very few mollusc (軟體動物) shells

#### 4.5.6. Supraglacial thrust ridge

##### - Debris band
1. 50 m inboard of the margin of Midtsundstadbreen
2. 85 m wide
3. Running parallel to the ice front
4. A diamictic composition
5. Large boulders are abundant on the surface
6. Similar to thrust moraines
7. A thrust moraine

##### - Thrust moraines
1. the material was brought up to the surface along thrust planes in the ice
> Thrusting : particularly common in the transition zone from warm interior ice to a frozen snout
