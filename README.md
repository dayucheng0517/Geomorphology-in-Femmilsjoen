# Geomorphology-in-Femmilsjoen
paper from Jack

## Abstract

### 1. Study Area
North Svalbard >> Spitsbergen >> Femmilsjoen Area

### 2. Regional Physiography
#### A low-relief, high elevation mountain plateau 
+ High-relief steep slopes
+ Low-relief coastal lowlands

### 3. Glaciers 
+ Warm-based
+ Erosive
+ Low terrain

### 4. Glaciers on Plateau
+ Colder
+ Less erosive
+ During the Late Weichselian

## Intro

### - Present
1. Glacial retreat
2. More frequent wave
3. Thawing of permafrost
4. Results in enhanced solifluction
5. Erosional and depositional processes

### - Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)
1.  the Svalbard Barents-Sea Ice Sheet covered the archipelago

### - Geomorphological maps
1. Reconstruct the spatiotemporal pattern of glacial retreat
2. Monitoring and comparison of future landscape change
3. Understanding of individual landforms and the links between them, as well as the process

### - Glaciers and Periglacial environments
1. Glaciers and ice caps cover 57% of the Svalbard archipelago
2. Large ice-cored moraines and exposed glacial bedforms are prominent formed by Late Holocene glacier advances
3. Several of these moraines originate from quasi-periodic dynamic surge advances, not directly related to mass balance

### - Nonglacial landforms
1. Blockfields
2. Alluvial fans
4. Areas with extensive raised marine sediments
5. Sets of beach ridges
6. Colluvial fans covering the steeper slopes

### - This Study
1. Geomorphological and surficial geologic mapping based on aerial image interpretation 
2. Field mapping of the terrestrial area surrounding Lake Femmilsjøen and the foreland of Midtsundstadbreen

## Setting

### 2.1 Study area

#### - Mapped area
1. West : Wijdefjorden
2. East : Longstaffbreen and Midtsundstadbreen
 + Longstaffbreen : a surge-type glacier (1960s)
 + Midtsundstadbreen :  a lobate shape with a relatively steep front
4. Results in enhanced solifluction
5. Erosional and depositional processes

#### - Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)
1.  the Svalbard Barents-Sea Ice Sheet covered the archipelago

#### - Geomorphological maps
1. Reconstruct the spatiotemporal pattern of glacial retreat
2. Monitoring and comparison of future landscape change
3. Understanding of individual landforms and the links between them, as well as the process
