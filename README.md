2. A terrace-shaped deposit
3. Consisting of sand and gravel
4. A kame (=knob) terrace deposited in an ice-dammed lake (In small areas, kames may form the terminal moraine.)

### 4.3 Raised marine deposits

#### 4.3.1.  Raised fine-grained glaciomarine deposits

##### - Diamict sediments with sporadic (零星的) clasts
1. Fine-grained, compact
2. Generally below 72 m a.s.l.
3. In the coastal area and the lower shores (between average low water neap tide 小潮 (MLWN) to the lowest the tide ever gets i.e. extreme low water spring tides 大潮 (ELWS).) of Femmilsjøen
4.Raised marine sediments

##### - Bivalve mollusc (斧足綱) shell fragments
1. Mya truncata
2. Hiatella arctica 

##### - Raised marine sediments 
1. Deposited in a glaciomarine environment, prior to postglacial glacioisostatic rebound
2. The composition is similar to observations of glaciomarine sediments in lake and marine sediment cores from the Femmilsjøen area (These landscape were form after Glacial retreat. So the original bedding may be raised marine sediments)

#### 4.3.2. Raised beach deposits

##### - Deposits of sand and gravel
1. 500m wide
2. Elevations from ~3 to ~72 m a.s.l.
3. Predominantly along the modern coastline of Wijdefjorden and up to 3.3 km inland
4. From coarse sand up to small boulders
5. ***Distinct ridges (~0.2 m high) occur (How the ridges were formed?)*** 【Raised marine deposits】
6. Raised beach deposits

##### - Raised beach deposits compared to modern
1. Coarser material
2. Shell fragments are rare
> The uppermost occurrence of raised beach deposits = The postglacial marine limit

### 4.4 Landforms of fluvial origin

Midtsundstadbreen
1. The orientation and gradient are predominantly towards north, parallel to the ice-margin
2. Drain into Femmilsjøen, where small deltas form
3. On the surface of the glaciofluvial deposits, periglacial landforms such as sorted circles and stripes occur

> Most of the active streams occur in the channels close to the glacier front

#### 4.4.2. Incised channels

##### - Channels incised in bedrock
1. Up to 12 m deep and 50 m wide
2. The incisions are old and progressive with phases of erosion during deglaciations
3. Maybe subglacial gorges or short-lived fluvial erosion during ice retreat

> Where channels are incised into sediments, they are more likely to be of Holocene age

### 4.5 Landforms of Holocene origin

#### 4.5.1. Blockfields

##### - Fields of large angular boulders
1. Local lithologies
2. Mostly or completely covering the surface constitute
3. Dominate the plateaus
4. Likely be active through the Holocene
5. May have been revitalised (恢復生機) or relict (遺留) from previous ice-free periods

#### 4.5.2. Talus (崖錐) covered slopes, colluvial fans and rock glaciers

##### - The steep slopes
1. Covered by angular, scattered talus
2. Originate from weathering processes and rock falls.
3. Dominated by fans of angular debris, interpreted as colluvial fans composed of avalanche (雪崩) and debris-flow deposits

##### - The undulating ridges
1. Coarse debris on the surface occur at the
foot of a few NW facing slopes, south of Femmilsjøen
> Pressure ridges : caused by the flow of ice-cemented
talus at the toe of the colluvial fans.
> Rock glaciers : consisting either of angular rock debris frozen in interstitial (間隙的) ice, former "true" glaciers overlain by a layer of talus, or something in-between

#### 4.5.3. Solifluction (土石緩滑) material

##### - The gentler slopes
1. Covered by a thin soil
2. Creep occurs in the active layer
3. Solifluction material

#### 4.5.4. Lacustrine (湖泊的) deposits

##### - The deposits
1. Fine-grained (primarily silt)
2. Along the lake shores and in depressions across the entire area
3. Some of them are coarser gravel
4. The deposits occur up to ~1 m above the current lake surfaces
5. Remnants after higher lake levels

##### - The lakes level
1. More glacier proximal conditions > Higher meltwater supply > Higher lake levels = Higher base level 
2. Increased precipitation during the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) > Higher lake levels
> Expansion of taliks below shallow lakes without distinct outflows could also lower the lake levels

#### 4.5.5. Modern beach deposits

##### - The deposits
1. Sand and gravel
2. ***With actively forming ridges (~0.3 m high) (How the ridges were formed?)*** 【Landforms of Holocene origin】
3. Up to 70 m wide
4. Up to 3 m a.s.l.
5. Separated by outcropping bedrock of positive relief
6. Occur in the bays along the coast of Wijdefjorden
7. Modern fair-weather beach ridges

##### - On the modern beaches

2. Very few mollusc (軟體動物) shells

#### 4.5.6. Supraglacial thrust ridge

##### - Debris band
1. 50 m inboard of the margin of Midtsundstadbreen
2. 85 m wide
3. Running parallel to the ice front
4. A diamictic composition
5. Large boulders are abundant on the surface
6. Similar to thrust moraines
7. A thrust moraine

##### - Thrust moraines
1. the material was brought up to the surface along thrust planes in the ice
> Thrusting : particularly common in the transition zone from warm interior ice to a frozen snout

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1. Temporal and spatial significance of landform and surficial deposit distribution

#### -  The last glaciation
+ The faint traces of striae on the bedrock in the coastal lowland
+ The thin till cover on the bedrock plateau
+ The scattered erratics of exotic lithologies
> Grounded ice 碎冰

#### -  The incised channels are most likely older and progressive with phases of erosion

#### - Femmilsjøen was connected to the fjord until between 11.7 and 11.3 cal. ka BP
+ Raised glaciomarine deposits = Marine and lake sediment cores from Wijdefjorden and Femmilsjøen

#### ***- The raised beach ridges are the results of gradual emergence after the deglaciation (Why it emerged?)*** 

#### - The marine deposits and ***beach ridges*** are formed prior to the form of the isolation threshold
       ***Isn't beach ridges and the isolation threshold formed at the same time?***
#### - Periglacial processes and slope processes initiated shortly after deglaciation of the area
> ***What is rockwall retreat?***

#### - The ice marginal positions mapped in the lowrelief coastal area represent dynamic re-advances of tributary (支流) glacier after retreat of the main glacier in Wijdefjorden

#### - The re-advances occurred into a high relative sea level prior to extensive glacioisostatic uplift
+ The wavewashed appearance of the mapped ice margin positions
+ No distinct sediment layer indicative of re-advance is observed in lake sediment cores
from Femmilsjøen
+ Better chronological control is needed in order
to assess the timing of re-advances

#### - The HTM was warm and wet
+ Glaciers had retreated out of the catchment area of Femmilsjøen
+ The active layer was thicker from Femmilsjøen
+ Periglacial processes more widespread as glaciers covered less

#### - Periglacial processes
+ Controlled by the frequency and rate of freeze and thaw
+ The moisture conditions of the substrate (基質)
+ Periglacial processes more widespread as glaciers covered less
+ *Permafrost is suggested to have re-established in the lowlands of Svalbard c. 3.0 cal. ka BP* Why?

#### - Frost-heave processes are active today
+ The abundant sorted circles and their clear sorting

### 5.2. Emergence and the highest coastline

#### - Marine limit
+ Up to 72 m a.s.l. aligns well with a progressive in-fjord higher marine limit
+ Femmilsjøen marine limit is at slightly higher than that from Mosselbukta
+ Indicates that the uplift has been more extensive around Femmilsjøen
+ The ice thickness and duration of ice cover was greater 10 km farther south during the Late Weichselian (Femmilsjoen的冰層和冰封時長比較久，所以回彈速度較快)

#### - The control factor of the postglacial marine limit
+ Ice cover thickness
+ Duration
+ The timing of deglaciation

### 5.3. Character of deglaciation and ice dynamics of Midtsundstadbreen

> Characteristics and Formation of Warm and Cold Based Glaciers
> + Warm based glaciers (=temperate glaciers) : 
>   1. Found in lower latitudes such as the Alps mountain range
>   2. The process of movement is largely through basal slippage due to the temporature
>   3. Liquid meltwater lubricate the contact surface
>   4. Roughly 3 metres per day
>   5. When the seasons change, the glacier will refreeze to the basal rock
>   6. Months later, when the temperature warms up again, the glacier will pluck material away (Increased erosion)
>
> + Cold based glaciers : 
>   1. Higher latitudes and have less seasonal variation in temperature
>   2. Move due to internal deformation/flow (Gravity and pressure exerted by ice accumulation)
>   3. 2cm per day
>   4. The ice crystals within the glacier orientate themselves into the same direction

#### - The thermal state of Svalbard glaciers has been documented to switch from polythermal to cold-based during retreat and thinning
+ As thinning allows for penetration of cold atmospheric temperatures to the bed of the ice

#### - Midtsundstadbreen could have switched from warm to cold after the LGM
+ as the ice sheet in the northern sector had already started thinning c. 25 ka ago, the switch may have occurred early (Maximum coverage was between 26,500 years and 19–20,000 years ago)

#### - Cold-based glaciers modify landscapes, however, ***at a rate of an order of magnitude lower (What it means?)*** 
> Geomorphological evidence of cold-based glacier activity
> + Erosional features
>   1. Broad scrapes and grooves (刮痕)
>   2. Irregular scuffs, (磨損) scrapes and scratches of exposed boulders embedded in pre-existing glacial deposits and meltwater channels
> + Depositional features
>   1. Thin patchy (散落的) drift 漂礫 (all material of glacial origin found anywhere on land or at sea, including sediment and large rocks)
>   2. Boulder belts
>   3. Drop moraines
>   4. Boulder trains and scattered boulders

#### - The periglacially altered till surface on the bedrock plateau resembles thin till deposits from cold-based glaciers in Antarctica

#### - The lack of Little ice age (LIA) moraines and ice marginal deposits
+ No traces of LIA advances were mapped around the NW margin of Åsgardfonna
+ Cold-based glacier fronts

#### - Few striations mapped in the Femmilsjøen area occur in the low-relief coastal area, and none were observed on the bedrock plateau
+ Only in the lower elevation areas, the ice was at the pressure melting point at the base and thus able to abrade the bedrock (Water, pressure up, melting point down. So water is hard to melt in high pressure.)

#### - The warm-based part of the ice sheet during the Late Weichselian was confined to fjords and lowlands below 200–230 m a.s.l., and that cold-based ice covered the higher elevated terrain in Nordaustlandet

#### - Cold-based areas are suggested to have prevailed above ~500 m a.s.l. in NW Iceland

#### - Reinsdyrflya was an interice-stream area during the Late Weichselian, with cold-based ice covering the strandflat and limited glacial imprints left in the area

#### - Predominantly coldbased ice has covered the bedrock plateau during the Late Weichselian
+ In Antarctica
  1. Very limited glacial imprints on the bedrock plateau
  2. Landscapes of cold-based glaciers
+ In Nordaustlandet
  1. The thrust moraine
  2. The similar overall elevation of the bedrock plateau
  3. Cold-based zones
  
#### - An alternative to a cold-based glacier interpretation to the lack of bedrock-erosional features on the plateau
+ The lithological and structural properties of the bedrock substratum in itself may influence the erodibility of the covering glacier ice

#### - Hard substratum and the presence of unfavourable structures slow the rate of subglacial erosion
+ Narrow joint spacing has been suggested to favour quarrying and higher erosion rates
+ More widely spaced joints favour abrasion and lower rates of erosion of the landscape

#### - The foliation is dominantly N-S striking and westward dipping
+ Tributary glaciers in the region exhibited dynamic
advances subsequent to (隨著) retreat of the main glacier in Wijdefjorden after LGM
+  If these dynamic post-LGM advances were across the plateau towards the west and thus oriented normal to the low-relief bedrock structures, quarrying could have been
favoured over abrasion, and could explain the lack of striations on the bedrock plateau

#### - Subglacially deposited landforms that are subaerially exposed are prone to weathering

#### - Deglaciated already by c. 16.0 cal. ka BP would leave substantial (充足的) time for weathering to erode any potentially deposited landforms

#### - The landscape on the plateau to have been little affected because the glacier was cold-based

#### - Be10, Al26 and in situ C14 cosmogenic exposure dating of the bedrock and erratics from the foreland of Midtsundstadbreen
+ The erosion history of the landscape
+ Identify it's warm- or cold-based ice during the Last Glacial

#### - The lack of landforms indicative of surge activity, related to advances of the surge-type glacier could be attributed to the regional bedrock
+ Such landforms may exist on the lake floor of Femmilsjøen
+ We could investigate it through multi-beam mapping of the lake floor
> Multibeam sonar : a type of active sonar system used to map the seafloor and detect objects in the water column or along the seafloor.

#### - Midtsundstadbreen was cold-based during its most recent advances
+ The few and faint moraine ridges on the bedrock plateau

#### - No modification by the 1960s surge of Longstaffbreen
+ the location of the thrust moraine on Midtsundstadbreen has not changed since 1936 to 2010

#### -  The snout of Midtsundstandbreen is currently stagnant (停滯不前) and frozen to the ground
+ The lack of change in frontal position although the overall mass balance of glaciers in Svalbard is negative

## 5. Summary and conclusions

### - The geomorphology of the bedrock plateau in front of
Midtsundstadbreen suggests that cold-based ice covered the plateau during the Late Weichselian

### - The coastal zone and areas below 72 m a.s.l. are dominated by raised glaciomarine sediments and beach ridges. In this area, warm-based ice streamed during the Late Weichselian.

### - Faint traces of ice-front positions in the low-relief coastal zone are suggested to belong to the deglaciation phase.

### - In the transition zone from coastal lowland to the bedrock plateau slope deposits dominate the steeper slopes and slope processes have most likely been active since deglaciation.

### - Presently, the snout of Midtsundstadbreen is passive and most likely cold-based. The presence of the thrust moraine may indicate the location of a former transition from warm-based to coldbased ice.

### - Periglacial landforms occur throughout the area
